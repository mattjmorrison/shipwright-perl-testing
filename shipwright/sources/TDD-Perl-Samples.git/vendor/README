This is an example Project developed in Perl using TDD

Dependencies:
Test::Unit
Test::Assert
Storable

Guidelines for Unit Tests:
1. should be atomic
2. should be order independent 
3. should be repeatable
4. should be isolated
5. should be intension revealing
6. should be easy to set up
7. should run fast


Guidelines for TDD:

1. Write a failing test
	a. run all tests
	b. make sure the new test fails
	a. make sure the new test fails for the reason that you expected it to fail

2. Write a little bit of code
	a. run all the tests
	b. if the test still fails, make sure it fails the way you expect and repeat #2

3. Refactor
	a. remove duplication (from both production code and from tests)
	b. remove smells
